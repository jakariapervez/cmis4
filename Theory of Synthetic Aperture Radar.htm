</p><h2>Electromagnetic Theory</h2>

Unlike optical and infrared imaging sensors which are inherently passive, meaning they 
rely on reflected or radiated energy, radar is an active sensor--providing its own 
illumination in the form of microwaves.  Microwaves are electromagnetic (EM) waves in 
approximately the 1-1000 GHz region of the EM spectrum, as illustrated in Figure 1.

<p>
An electromagnetic wave is a self-propagating wave (requiring no medium to travel 
through) consisting of electric and magnetic fields whose intensities follow a sinusoidal 
pattern. These fields are perpendicular to each other and in phase as shown in Figure 2.

<p>
One wavelength (<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/lambda.gif">) is the distance from one crest to the next crest. The frequency (<i>f</i>) of 
the wave is the number of crests to travel one wavelength per unit time. The 
propagation velocity (or phase velocity) of the wave is dependent on the medium through 
which it is traveling.  It is calculated as:

</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn1.gif">

<p>
where <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/mu.gif"> and <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif"> are the permeability and
permittivity, respectively, of the medium.  These are inherent electromagnetic
qualities specific to different types of matter. The lowest values these can
have are <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/mu.gif"><sub><i><small>0</small></i></sub> and
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif"><sub><i><small>0</small></i></sub> which occur for a
vacuum (free space). Thus the maximum velocity of light is within a vacuum and
is equal to:

<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn2.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
Air is so diffuse that within it the velocity of an EM wave can still be considered to be
<i>c</i>. The wavelength and frequency are related to the velocity by the equation:

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn3.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where <i>v</i> is the velocity in metres per second, <i>f</i> is the
frequency in Hertz (cycles per second) and <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/lambda.gif"> is the wavelength in metres.

</p><p>
The ratio of the electric field intensity <i>E</i> to the magnetic field
intensity <i>B</i> at any moment is always equal to the speed of light in a vacuum.

</p><center>

</p></center>

<p>
The polarization of the EM wave refers to the direction of the electric field
vector. In radar science, the wave is said to be polarized in the direction
of its <i>E</i> vector.

</p><h2>Principles of Real Aperture Radar</h2>

The two main types of radar images are the circularly scanning plan-position indicator 
(PPI) images and the side-looking images. The PPI applications are limited to the 
monitoring of air and naval traffic. Remote sensing applications use the side-looking 
images which are divided into two types--real aperture radar (usually called SLAR for 
side-looking airborne radar or SLR for side-looking radar) and synthetic aperture radar 
(SAR).
<p>
The SLAR imaging system uses a long, straight antenna mounted on a platform (aircraft 
or satellite), with its longitudinal axis parallel to the flight path.  The antenna emits 
pulses of electromagnetic energy directed perpendicular to the flight path of the platform 
and downward to the surface of the Earth, as illustrated in Figure 3.  These pulses fall 
within a narrow area on the ground and are scattered, usually in many directions, 
including the direction of the antenna.  The return echoes arrive at the antenna at 
different times, depending on the distance from the antenna to the specific scattering 
object on the ground.

</p><h3>Range Resolution</h3>
Range is the direction perpendicular to flight path of the aircraft. The
vertical beamwidth <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theta.gif">, shown in Figure 3, is determined by
the wavelength (<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/lambda.gif">) and the antenna height
<i>W<sub><small>a</small></sub></i> such that <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theta.gif"><sub><i><small>v</small></i></sub>
= <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/lambda.gif"> / <i>W<sub><small>a</small></sub></i>. Referring to Figure 4, we see that the
width of the ground swath <i>W<sub><small>g</small></sub></i>, also called the range extent, is simply
calculated as:

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn5.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
and so

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn6.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/nu.gif"> is the incidence angle of the beam at the midpoint
of the swath (equal to the look angle <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/phi.gif">) and
<i>R<sub><small>m</small></sub></i>
is the slant range (distance) from the antenna to the midpoint of the swath.

</p><center>

</p><p><i>Figure 4. Range resolution of a side-looking real aperture radar.</i>
</p></center>

<p>
Ground resolution is defined as the minimum distance on the ground at which
two object points can be imaged separately, shown in Figure 4 as the distance
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/delta.gif"><i>R<sub><small>g</small></sub></i>. Two objects can be distinguished if the leading
edge of the pulse echo from the more distant object arrives at the antenna
later than the trailing edge of the pulse echo from the nearer object. Thus
if their distances to the antenna are different by at least half of the
pulse length (the distance the pulse travels in the time
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/tau.gif"><sub><i><small>p</small></i></sub> during which the transmitter is turned on) then the
objects are resolvable. Therefore the ground range resolution is

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn7.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/delta.gif"><i>R<sub><small>g</small></sub></i> is the slant range resolution,
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/nu.gif"> is the incidence angle, <i>L<sub><small>p</small></sub></i> is the pulse length (in 
units of distance), <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/tau.gif"><sub><i><small>p</small></i></sub> is the pulse
duration (in units of
time) and <i>c</i> is the speed of light. Note that as you approach the nadir
line directly below the aircraft, <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/nu.gif"> approaches zero making
sin(<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/nu.gif">) approach zero so that the ground range resolution
becomes extremely poor. This makes sense since the objects near the nadir
line are all virtually the same distance from the antenna, making them
impossible to distinguish.

</p><p>
To achieve a ground range resolution small enough to be useful, the pulse duration
çp would have to be too short to generate enough energy to produce a sufficient echo signal 
to noise ratio (SNR).  To get around this, a technique known as pulse compression is 
often used together with a type of processing of the returned signal known as matched 
filtering (which we will not go into here, though a good description can be found in 
Curlander, see <a href="http://www.geo.uzh.ch/~fpaul/sar_references.html">SAR References</a>) to produce both high resolution and a 
high SNR.  The ground range resolution possible with these techniques is

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn8.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where <i>B<sub><small>R</small></sub></i> is the frequency bandwidth of the
transmitted radar pulse. The resolution can be further improved by increasing
the frequency bandwidth.

</p><h3>Azimuth Resolution</h3>
Azimuth is the direction parallel to the flight path of the aircraft. Figure 3 shows that 
the angular spread of the radar beam in the azimuth direction is equal to
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theta.gif"><sub><i><small>H</small></i></sub> = <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/lambda.gif"> /
<i>L<sub><small>a</small></sub></i> where <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/lambda.gif">
is the wavelength of the transmitted beam and <i>L<sub><small>a</small></sub></i> is the length of the radar antenna in 
the azimuth direction.  This spread is due to interference of the waves emitted from and 
received by the dipoles of the antenna, which causes the angular spread to decrease as 
the aperture length increases (a longer antenna produces a tighter beam, much as a 
longer barrel of a gun produces less dispersion).  Two objects on the ground and with 
the same slant range <i>R</i> can only be imaged separately if they are not both within the 
radar beam at the same time.  Thus the azimuth resolution is

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn9.gif">
</p></center>

<h2>Principles of Synthetic Aperture Radar</h2>
Because of the way in which microwaves interact with the atmosphere and the ground, 
only a select few frequency bands are useful for imaging.  These are shown in Figure 5.  
The wavelength affects the penetration depth and also the size of a target necessary to 
return the radar.  This shall be discussed later.

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_fig5.gif" alt="Microwave Frequency Bands" width="575" height="152">
</p><p><i>Figure 5. Microwave frequency bands useful for imaging.</i>
</p></center>

<p>
For a specific frequency <i>f</i> (or wavelength <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/lambda.gif">) and
slant range <i>R</i>, the azimuth resolution is entirely dependent on the
aperture length <i>L<sub><small>a</small></sub></i>. However, for the altitudes at which 
satellite or airborne imaging sensors operate (in the 1-10 GHz region),
engineering difficulties make it is impossible to achieve values of
<i>L<sub><small>a</small></sub></i> / <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/lambda.gif"> greater than several hundred. 
For example, the new Canadian satellite RADARSAT, launched in 1995, orbits 
at 792 km and operates at a frequency of 5.3 GHz (C-Band). The real aperture
limit to the azimuth resolution would be

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn10.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
Through the use of synthetic aperture technology, however, RADARSAT can
achieve a resolution as low as 9 m.
</p><p>
It was in 1951 that Carl Wiley first realized that the Doppler spread of the echo signal 
could be used to synthesize a much longer aperture (thus the name synthetic aperture 
radar) to greatly improve the resolution of a side-looking radar.

</p><h3>The Doppler Effect</h3>
When a detector moves with respect to a source of waves, a shift in frequency is 
observed known as the Doppler effect.  When a source emitting waves with frequency
<i>f</i> recedes from the observer at a velocity <i>v</i>, the observed frequency is

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn11.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
When the source approaches the observer, the observed frequency is

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn12.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where <i>v</i> is always positive. Thus a receding source exhibits a lower frequency and an 
approaching source exhibits a <i>higher</i> frequency than the <i>actual</i> frequency emitted.
</p><p>
When two target points on the ground are separated in the azimuth direction, they are 
at slightly different angles from the antenna with respect to the line of flight.  Because of 
this, they have slightly different speeds at any given moment relative to the antenna.  
Therefore the signal echoed from each target will have its frequency shifted a different 
amount from the original.  To calculate the Doppler frequency shift for a specific target, 
refer to Figure 6 as we first calculate <i>dR/dt</i>--the relative speed with which the target and 
antenna approach each other.

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_fig6.gif" alt="SAR Geometry" width="291" height="397">
</p><p><i>Figure 6. SAR geometry for calculating the Doppler frequency shift for a point target.</i>
</p></center>

<p>
To find the <i>R</i>-directional component of <i>V<sub><small>rel</small></sub></i>
(the velocity with which the target approaches the sensor), we can project
<i>V<sub><small>rel</small></sub></i> (parallel to <i>x</i>) onto a line parallel to
<i>R</i> to get

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn13.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
Now, we can calculate the frequency observed by the ground target:

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn14.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
But for <i>v</i> &lt;&lt; <i>c</i>, <i>v</i><sup><small>2</small></sup> /
<i>c</i><sup><small>2</small></sup> approaches 0. Therefore

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn15.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
This frequency is different from the actual frequency emitted from the antenna by the 
amount

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn16.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
Since the return echo will be shifted by the same amount, the Doppler frequency shift 
for the target is

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn17.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
This value provides a means of determining exactly where the echo signal came from.  
For a return signal detected by the antenna at a time corresponding to the slant range R 
(<i>t</i> = 2<i>R</i>/<i>c</i>) and with a Doppler frequency shift of
<i>f<sub><small>d</small></sub></i>, the azimuth coordinate must be

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn18.gif">.
</p></center>

<p>
Even if another target is at range <i>R</i> and within the beam at the same
time, measurement of its Doppler frequency shift <i>f<sub><small>d</small></sub></i>
still allows us to
associate it with an azimuth coordinate <i>x</i><sub><small>2</small></sub>.
Thus for any target point, we now have two coordinates to localize it--the
ground range <i>R<sub><small>g</small></sub></i>, relative to the nadir line,
and the azimuth distance <i>x</i><sub><small>2</small></sub> relative to broadside.

</p><h3>SAR Azimuth Resolution</h3>
Utilizing the Doppler effect cannot increase the range resolution but it does greatly 
increase the azimuth resolution. From the equation for Doppler frequency shift, the 
azimuth resolution can be calculated as

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn19.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/delta.gif"><i>f<sub><small></small></sub></i> is the
resolution of the Doppler frequency shift--approximately equal to the 
inverse of the time during which the point target was in the beam,
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/delta.gif"><i>f<sub><small>d</small></sub></i> <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/approx_equals.gif"> 1 / <i>t</i><sub><small>span</small></sub>.
This time span can be calculated as

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn20.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
Therefore the azimuth resolution is

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn21.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
which implies that better resolution is obtained with a smaller antenna--not what one 
would expect since this is opposite to the rule for real aperture radar.  This does not 
mean, of course, that one could simply build an antenna 1 cm long to obtain a 
resolution of 5 mm.  The length of the aperture must be large enough to create the 
proper interference pattern between the dipoles of the antenna necessary for the desired 
beamspread at a particular frequency--
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theta.gif"><sub><small><i>H</i></small></sub> = <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/lambda.gif">
/ <i>L<sub><small>a</small></sub></i>.

</p><p>
This result of <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/delta.gif"><sub><small><i>x</i></small></sub> =
<i>L<sub><small>a</small></sub></i> / 2 is not strictly true, however, since
we assumed that a constant Doppler frequency shift was observed during the
entire time <i>t</i><sub><small>span</small></sub>. In fact,
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/delta.gif"><i>f<sub><small>d</small></sub></i> changes 
throughout the observation and is only approximately constant for a time much less 
than <i>t</i><sub><small>span</small></sub>.
A Fourier analysis of the Doppler waveform results in frequency components 
at various frequencies so that the target is observed to spread out over multiple 
resolution cells, covering a distance greater than the resolution
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/delta.gif"><i>x</i> calculated above.

</p><h3>SAR Azimuth Compression</h3>
As the radar beam passes over the point target, as in Figure 7, the slant range to the 
target varies--decreasing to a minimum and then increasing again.  Thus one target 
traces a hyperbolic line in the azimuth-slant range plane.  This hyperbola is known as 
the range migration curve and the line joining the two ends is known as the rangewalk.  
Since this hyperbola is representative of only one point, all the points along this curve 
must be compressed to form a single pixel in the final image.  There are several 
problems involved in this, however.  First, the shape of the hyperbolic line depends 
greatly on the slant range distance to the target when at the centre of the radar beam.  
Second, the system impulse response changes with slant range.  That is, the received 
signal is sensitive to the time delay, thus requiring different filter parameters to 
maintain the constant power requirement.

<p>
An airborne SAR has an altitude low enough to consider the Earth as a flat surface.  The 
hyperbola will be very flat since the range differences for one target are relatively small.  
When operating from a satellite, however, the altitude is high enough that the curvature 
of the Earth becomes a factor, extending the hyperbola.  Also, the rotation of the Earth 
warps it to one side in the range direction.  These effects must be corrected before the 
compression processing can begin.

<p>
When two waves are not synchronous with each other, they are said to be out of phase.  
The phase difference is measured in radians or degrees.  For instance, if the wave A's 
crest occurs at the same time as wave B's trough, the phase difference is
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/pi.gif"> (or 180º). 
Figure 8 illustrates further examples.

<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn27.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
Therefore the time window is

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn28.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
Therefore, the new azimuth resolution is

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn29.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
A SAR processor which uses this technique is known as unfocused SAR.  This technique 
does not account for the variable rate of phase change, but still manages to produce a 
resolution much smaller than that for real aperture radars.  For example, using the 
above equation, the resolution for RADARSAT would be

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn30.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
as opposed to the real aperture limit of 3.0 km.

</p><p>
The resolution can get even better, however, by using a focused SAR processor which 
accounts for the nonlinear phase change. This technique uses all the data collected 
during the time that the target is within the beam.  The quadratic phase
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/phi.gif"> is adjusted such that all the return signals due to the
target at <i>x<sub><small>0</small></sub></i> (see Figure 9) are added 
coherently. Any returns from targets not at <i>x<sub><small>0</small></sub></i>
will not agree with the adjusted returns so they will cancel. Thus the returns
from the target at <i>x<sub><small>0</small></sub></i> will dominate the returns from 
other targets with the same range but not at <i>x<sub><small>0</small></sub></i>.
With a few assumptions, this technique results in an azimuth resolution
approaching <i>L<sub><small>a</small></sub></i> / 2, which is what we calculated
before, assuming a constant phase.

</p><h2>Geometric Distortions</h2>
At first glance, a SAR image may seem to closely resemble an optical image.  Closer 
inspection, however, reveals striking differences which can be used, given knowledge of 
how radar interacts with ground features, to provide a wide spectrum of information 
about the targets.  The most obvious difference from an optical image is the geometric 
distortion produced due to the depression angle and the height or slope of the target.

<h3>Slant vs. Ground Range</h3>
When terrain is imaged using an optical sensor such as a camera, the image can be 
thought of as a central perspective projection--all of the terrain points have projection 
lines passing through a central point on their way to their corresponding image points, 
as in Figure 10a.  The situation for a SAR is very much different, however, in that 
ground objects will be placed into locations on the image line as a function of their 
distance from the antenna--not as a function of their distance from each other on the 
ground.  Figure 10b shows that the projection lines are concentric circles around the 
antenna, due to the spherical spreading of EM pulses.

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_fig10.gif">
</p><p><i>Figure 10. Image projections for (a) optical and (b) SAR imaging systems.</i>
</p></center>

<p>
Suppose you are imaging objects A and B, separated a distance   on the ground, as 
shown in Figure 11.  Because the SAR is viewing from an angle, the two points will look 
closer together than they actually are.  Since angle ACB is approximately 90º, we can 
say that <i>D<sub><small>g</small></sub></i> in slant range presentation is

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn31.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
so that the distance in slant range presentation is always less than in the corresponding 
ground range projection. As the depression angle <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theta.gif"> gets larger,
<i>D<sub><small>s</small></sub></i> gets smaller for a given distance
<i>D<sub><small>g</small></sub></i>. Thus the slant range presentation
compresses the terrain features in the near range more than in the far range.
This has the effect of greatly stretching the ground range projection near
the nadir where <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theta.gif"> approaches 90º.

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_fig11.gif">
</p><p><i>Figure 11. Image of points A and B in slant range and ground range presentations.</i>
</p></center>

<p>
The ground range presentation is used when one wishes to match the image with known 
target locations (i.e. geocoding the image) on the ground.
<a href="http://www.geo.uzh.ch/products/EarthView.html"> EarthView</a> is able to convert an image from slant
range to ground range and visa versa, taking into account the curvature
of the Earth for satellite imagery.

</p><h3>Relief Displacement</h3>
Imaging a target on top of a vertical structure height <i>h</i> above the ground results in a 
relief displacement, that is, the target is displaced a distance of
<i>r<sub><small>s</small></sub></i> in the original slant range presentation
of the image, as shown in Figure 12.

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_fig12.gif">
</p><p><i>Figure 12. Relief displacement due to a vertical structure.</i>
</p></center>

<p>
The relief displacement <i>r<sub><small>g</small></sub></i> is equal to the
distance <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/PgX.gif">, however for a small enough value of <i>h</i>,
we see that <i>P<sub><small>g</small></sub>X</i> <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/approx_equals2.gif">
<i>P'X</i>. Thus we can estimate the relief displacement in ground 
presentation as

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn32.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
and in slant range presentation as
 
</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn33.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
Thus the relief displacement is proportional to the height of the vertical structure and 
increases the closer that structure is to the nadir line.

</p><h3>Lay Over</h3>
The direction of relief displacement is different for optical and radar systems.  A camera 
sees the relief displaced away from the nadir point while the SAR see the relief displaced 
towards the nadir line.  This is illustrated in Figure 13.

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_fig13.gif">
</p><p><i>Figure 13. A comparison of relief displacement for (a) optical and (b) SAR systems.</i>
</p></center>

<h3>Shadows</h3>
The other effect of vertical structures is to produce shadows in the SAR image.  Figures 
12 and 13 illustrate this effect quite well.  Because the radar beam is at an angle, there 
will be a region of ground behind the vertical structure that the beam cannot reach.  
Thus for the time period corresponding to that ground area, no echoes will be returned.  
This results in a black area on the image which is called a shadow.  From Figure 12, the 
length of the shadow is calculated as

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn34.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
in ground range presentation and

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn35.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
in slant range presentation.  Thus the length of the shadow is proportional to the height 
of the vertical structure and increases the further away that structure is from the nadir 
line or the lower the SAR antenna is.

</p><h3>Image of a Slope</h3>
The effects of imaging sloping terrain with radar are illustrated in Figure 14.  Due to the 
vertical height, relief displacement, lay over and shadows can result, depending on the 
steepness of the slope.  Slopes facing the nadir line can exhibit the effects of (a) lay over, 
(c) foreshortening and the in-between case (b) for which the front slope appears only as a 
line.  Case (b) only occurs when the slope is parallel to the nadir line and the elevation 
angle <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/gamma.gif"> equals the slope angle <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/alpha.gif"> exactly.

<p>
Slopes facing away from the nadir line can be (a) fully imaged, (c) hidden in the radar 
shadow or (b) strangely imaged as the radar beam just skims along the surface.  For 
case (b), slight irregularities on the slope's surface would have magnified effects.  For 
instance, a bump near the peak would block the radar from the rest of the slope causing 
a shadow to appear in the image.

<h2>Surface Interaction with the Radar Beam</h2>
When an electromagnetic wave reflects off a surface, three basic properties of
the surface come into play--the dielectric constant (or permittivity 
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif">), the roughness (rms height relative to a smooth
surface) and the local slope.

<p>
Assuming that the EM wave is traveling through a medium that is homogeneous 
(properties do not vary from point to point), isotropic (properties are the same in all 
directions from any given point) and non-magnetic, then from Maxwell's equations we 
can express the complex electric field vector as

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn36.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where <b>A</b> is the amplitude vector, <i>z</i> is the distance traveled in time
<i>t</i> and <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/phi.gif"> is a phase offset. The angular frequency
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/omega.gif"> is

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn37.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where <i>f<sub><small>c</small></sub></i> is the carrier frequency (the
frequency emitted from the antenna) and <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/lambda.gif"> is the 
wavelength. The expression for <i>k'</i> is

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn38.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where <i>k</i> is the wavenumber and <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif"><sub><small><i>r</i></small></sub>
is the relative permittivity (also called the dielectric constant) of the
medium (<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif"><sub><small><i>r</i></small></sub> =
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif"> / <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif"><sub><small>0</small></sub>
where <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif"> is the permittivity of the medium and 
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif"><sub><small>0</small></sub> is the permittivity of
free space). It should be noted that
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif"><sub><small><i>r</i></small></sub> is a function of
the frequency of the EM wave. The relative permeability
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/mu.gif"><sub><small><i>r</i></small></sub> has been assumed to be
equal to 1 which is accurate enough for microwave frequencies.
</p><p>
The polarization of the electric field <b>E</b> is the direction of the amplitude
vector <b>A</b> at some 
instant in time. For a linearly polarized wave, the direction of <b>A</b> is fixed in one plane 
relative to the direction of propagation.  An elliptically polarized wave has an electric 
field consisting of two different components oriented along orthogonal axes such that

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn39.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
resulting in the total amplitude vector <b>A</b> slowly rotating about the
<i>z</i>-axis. If <b>A</b><sub><small><i>x</i></small></sub> =
<b>A</b><sub><small><i>y</i></small></sub> and
[<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/phi.gif"><sub><small>1</small></sub> - 
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/phi.gif"><sub><small>2</small></sub>] = <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/pi.gif">/2,
then the wave becomes <i>circularly polarized</i>.

</p><p>
An EM wave interacting with a surface is called <i>scattering</i>. There are two types—surface 
scattering and volume scattering.  Surface scattering occurs at the interface between 
two different homogeneous media such as the atmosphere and the Earth's surface.  
Volume scattering is the result of interaction with particles within a non-homogeneous 
medium.

</p><h3>Surface Scattering</h3>
A smooth surface acts as a mirror, reflecting the EM wave at an angle equal and 
opposite to the incidence angle <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/nu.gif">.
Thus a smooth level surface is seen as black in the 
SAR image since the echoes never reach the antenna.  The Rayleigh criterion defines a 
surface as smooth if

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn40.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where <i>h</i> is the surface roughness, defined as the root-mean-square (rms) height relative 
to a <i>perfectly</i> smooth surface, <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/lambda.gif"> is the
wavelength of the wave and <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/nu.gif"> is the angle of 
incidence.  Peake and Oliver (1971) modified this criterion by defining upper and lower 
values of <i>h</i> for surfaces of intermediate roughness to obtain a smoothness criterion of 

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn41.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
Using the Rayleigh criterion, for instance, when RADARSAT is operating at 5.3 GHz with 
an incidence angle of 50º, level terrain with h &lt; 9 mm will show up as solid black.

</p><h4>Specular Scattering</h4>
Any returns from a smooth level surface are due to specular scattering, in which the EM 
wave's angle of incidence is equal and opposite to the angle of reflection and the 
transmission through the surface obeys Snell's Law:

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn42.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where <i>n</i> and <i>n'</i> are the index of refractions of the two mediums,
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/nu.gif"> is the angle of incidence and <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/nu.gif">'
is the angle of refraction, shown in Figure 16.  However, the index of 
refraction is equal to

</p><center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn43.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
For a non-magnetic medium, <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/mu.gif"><sub><small><i>r</i></small></sub>
= 1, and for air, <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif"><sub><small><i>r</i></small></sub>
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/approx_equals2.gif"> 1. Therefore Snell's Law becomes

</p></center>

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_fig14.gif">
</p><p><i>Figure 16. Specular scattering mechanism.</i>
</p></center>

<p>
For the perfect specular reflector, radar returns (backscatter) exist only near vertical 
incidence (due to a 90º depression angle or the slope of the surface) and the reflected 
energy is localized to a small angular region around the angle of reflection.  Even for 
non-vertical incidence, however, backscatter can exist for a rough subsurface if the 
radar is capable of penetrating deep enough.  Figure 16 illustrates how it is possible to 
image a subsurface (i.e. the surface of a different medium below the top surface) that 
would otherwise be invisible to optical sensors.

</p><h4>Bragg Scattering</h4>
For a homogeneous medium with a slightly rough surface (an rms  height variation of 
less than <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/lambda.gif">/8), the scattering can be described using the Bragg model.
The surface features can be described in terms of a spatial spectrum. Any section of that spectrum 
which resonates with the incident wave will produce a strong backscatter. Thus, a 
strong return will result from surface variation patterns at wavelengths of

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn44.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where the dominant return is due to the wavelength <img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/gamma_big.gif">
for which <i>n</i>=1. At steep incidence angles, the backscatter is
usually a combination of both specular and Bragg scattering.
</p><p>
The Bragg model is useful for describing the backscatter from the ocean surface.  Water 
has a large dielectric constant making volume scattering impossible (see section 2.5.2).  
The periodic structure of ocean waves resonate well with radar waves, showing up as 
periodic bands on the image.  When imaging slightly rough terrain with little vegetation, 
the Bragg model can be used to classify rock types and ages based on the surface 
roughness.

</p><h3>Volume Scattering</h3>
Natural surfaces usually result in both surface scattering and volume scattering.  
Natural surfaces are generally inhomogeneous, meaning they are composed of different 
mediums.  Depending on the radar wavelength and the permittivity of the media, the EM 
wave will penetrate a certain depth beneath the surface.  The depth at which the 
refracted portion of the wave will be attenuated by 1/<i>e</i> of its original power at the surface 
boundary is

<center>
<p><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/theory_eqn45.gif">
</p></center>

<p>
where the relative dielectric constant is given by the complex number
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif"><sub><small><i>r</i></small></sub> = 
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif">' + <i>i</i><img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif">'' and
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif">''/<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif">' 
must be less than 0.1 for the equation to be valid.
</p><p>
Since every type of material has its own characteristic dielectric constant
<img src="Theory%20of%20Synthetic%20Aperture%20Radar_files/epsilon.gif"><sub><small><i>r</i></small></sub>, the media 
are dielectrically variant which results in volume scattering. If the different media are 
mixed together in a mostly random manner, the backscatter will be in many directions.  
The fraction of the incident wave that is reflected back to the antenna, then, depends on 
the shape, density and orientation of the different media as well as on the relative 
permittivity between them.

</p><h3>Complex Dielectric Constant</h3>
The complex dielectric constant of most natural materials, when dry, is between 3 and 8 
(for a typical radar frequency).  For such values, the penetration depth is quite large and 
the reflectivity correspondingly small.  The dielectric constant for water, on the other 
hand, is around 80 (for the same frequency) resulting in high reflectivity from the 
surface and almost no penetration.  The complex dielectric constant for a material varies 
almost linearly with the moisture content per unit volume.  The higher the moisture 
content, the lesser the penetration depth is and the greater the reflectivity is.  The 
observed variation in reflectivity from natural surfaces is mainly due to the moisture 
content of the vegetation or soil.  Thus an analysis of the returns for a specific region 
allows for classification of the type of soil or vegetation being imaged.

<p>
Since the dielectric constant depends on the frequency of the EM wave, so does the 
reflectivity.  The higher the frequency (or the lower the wavelength), the lesser the 
penetration is.  If one is imaging a forest, for example, using a high frequency will result 
in surface scatter from the top of the vegetation canopy while a lower frequency would 
allow the EM waves to penetrate the canopy, producing volume scattering from the 
leaves, branches, trunks or ground.

</p><h3>Polarization</h3>
The polarization of an EM wave refers to the orientation of the electric field intensity 
vector.  A SAR usually transmits a wave such that it is horizontally polarized.  Most of 
the received energy is still horizontally polarized, however a small portion of it may be 
<i>depolarized</i> through interaction with the terrain, creating many different components at 
various angles of polarization.

<p>
Using a filter at the antenna, all polarizations can be screened out except for the desired 
polarization--either horizontal or vertical.  The HH (transmit and receive horizontal) 
configuration is called the like-polarized return while the HV (transmit horizontal and 
receive vertical) configuration is called the cross-polarized return.  The HV return 
requires a much higher antenna gain than the HH due to its much smaller energy.

</p><p>
The images produced by these two returns may differ due to the differences between the 
scattering processes for each.  Depolarization, for instance, is usually explained in terms 
of volume scatter or multiple reflections.  At short wavelengths, when the terrain can be 
considered very rough, like- and cross-polarized images are almost identical.  At longer 
wavelengths, however, when the terrain is considered relatively smooth, noticeable 
differences stand out.  This has resulted in limited geological application in identifying 
rock types.

</p><p>
Some of the new polarimetric SARs are capable of transmitting and receiving both 
horizontally and vertically thus allowing HH, HV, VH and VV returns all at the same 
time.  Mathematical analysis of these returns can create a geometric basis which can be 
used to synthesize the image for <i>any</i> possible transmit/receive polarization for the entire 
360º spectrum. Certain objects, especially those man-made, have been found to stand 
out at a specific transmit/receive polarization, thus making their detection easier in the 
future.  

</p><h3>Speckle</h3>
All SAR images inherently contain noise, whether due to the hardware or to stray 
radiation from other sources or to the phenomenon known as speckle.  Speckle 
manifests itself in the image as the apparently random placement of pixels which are 
conspicuously bright or dark.  It arises from the requirement that a SAR image be 
formed using <i>coherent</i> radar--radar that can provide a Doppler resolution.

<p>
A single resolution cell, or pixel, corresponds to an area of a certain size on the ground.  
Within that area, there exist many different targets, or scatterers, which provide the 
surface texture necessary for backscatter.  Even though the area may be something on 
the order of 15 x 15 metres, the wavelength of the EM wave may be only several 
centimetres--capable of interacting with each individual scatterer.  These multiple 
interactions produce echoes which interfere with each other in either a constructive or 
destructive manner.  Constructive interference results in a strong return signal and a 
bright pixel in the image.  Destructive interference results in a weak return signal and 
dark pixel in the image.

</p></font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
By interpreting speckle as a random noise effect, various methods can be used to 
reduce speckle.  Neighbouring pixels can be averaged together to spread the aberration 
out at the cost of  resolution.  This is known as a multiple look image. 
<a href="http://www.geo.uzh.ch/products/EarthView.html"> EarthView</a> provides a median filter, in which you can specify the size of the window of pixels to 
average, and a LUM Filter which uses a completely different rank-order-based
technique. <a href="http://www.geo.uzh.ch/products/EarthView.html"> EarthView</a> provides other filters for speckle reduction
(Lee, Frost, MAP and Refined MAP) which smooth the data without blurring 
it as the median filter does.
